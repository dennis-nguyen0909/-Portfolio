    "This is my semester project. I use java to handle the logic and models, and for the interface I use java swing. I use Map to manage keywords with keys and values, my project includes the basic functions of a dictionary application. The function I like most is looking up words with the Levenshtein algorithm to find the closest word when not in the map.":"This is my semester project.

    "I taught myself nodejs and reactjs and learned how to create a complete website. I wrote RestfulAPI, using jwt to authenticate users. Combined react-text-to-speach to develop voice search function and integrated openAi with nlp to train more data for AI model for customers Customers can get more information about the shop. This project has many errors that I have not optimized to increase user experience.":"I taught myself nodejs and reactjs and learned how to create a complete website.

    "This is my 2nd project using MERN. I wrote restfullAPI for users, posts, reels, messages,.... Implement real-time messaging as well as real-time comments and likes. I store images and videos on cloudinary through multer so I can post multiple photos or one photo for users. For the user interface, I use antd . The project is in the process of being stopped because I'm busy with a lot of work, but will probably continue after a while to complete a complete project.":"This is my 2nd project using MERN.
